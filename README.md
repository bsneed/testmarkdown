[AClass](./AClass.md)
----

This is a class that does classy things.
Part of that is messing with full names, partial names, and all the names.
It does names, better than the world has ever seen.  As a matter of fact,
people have called me to tell me just *how* good at names this class is.

We will protect the names in this country.  The american people demand it,
and frankly, my administration is known for handling names well.  Fake
news or not, names will get handled.

As a matter of fact, my class handles names way classier than crooked Hillary
could ever hope.  My camp of deplorables will always handle names better than
any of crooked Hillary's.  Once we build a wall, all the bad hombres that 
want to come get a free ride while messing with our names.

Let me be very clear with this example:

```swift
AClass.dontFuck(with: me, and: myNames)
```

And that's all I have to say about that.
